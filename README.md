# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Project
This repository contains my data analysis projects where I explore existing real-world datasets, find interesting topics or questions, and perform detailed analysis. The goal is to derive insights and showcase the results through interactive and static visualizations.

For each project, I will:

Explore the Dataset: Understand the structure, features, and context of the dataset.
Define a Topic or Research Question: Identify a key topic or question that can be answered using the data.
Data Cleaning & Preparation: Process and clean the data to ensure it's ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform an in-depth analysis to discover trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.
Data Visualization: Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, or Tableau to create compelling visual representations of the findings.
Insights & Conclusions: Summarize key findings and insights based on the analysis and visualization.

Technologies & Tools:

Programming Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
Data: CSV, Excel, or other public datasets
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau

Each project will include:

Jupyter Notebooks with code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Visualizations that highlight key findings.
Detailed README files explaining the project's context, methodology, and results.
